The energy looks like this but in much higher dimensions

The convexity guarantees that â€¦.. (written in paper) so that if you have a currrent partition any new partition will always have that to be true, meaning that 

If you find an an algorithms so that this quantity is positive, that guarantees taht E at the next partition is above thiws positive quantity so is above the previous quantity.

If algorithm guarantees that it also says that the energy  of the new partition is greater than that E of the previous partitions

This line here is the linearized energy obtained by linearizing the energy arround the current partition

Here we are saying that we want an algorithm that guarantees increase of the linearized energy.

Convexity implies that the actual energy is above the linearized energy so if you guarantee that the linearized energy increase, then you also guarantee that the actual energy incerases 

The equation describese by how much the linearized energy is going to increase if I move from the current partition to the next partition (it is going to encrease by exactly this quantity) and you want that to be positive.

We implement a greede algorithm which always guarantees that the next partition increases the linearized energy. Because there is an explicit formula, it is not hard to find such an algorith,.

Why does the diffuse and threshold guarantee that the above occures

Look at the INCRES paper![Screen Shot 2017-11-06 at 8.56.08 PM](/Users/ndibbern/Documents/Main/LMU-RSCH-Fall17/Documents/Notes/Screen Shot 2017-11-06 at 8.56.08 PM.png)
